## Click the Badges Below to Access the Colab Notebooks

These Google Colab notebooks describe how to get started with the contest
in the two most popular deep learning frameworks,
how to submit results,
and how to use pretrained networks to get better results.

### Iterating quickly in Colab
Google Colab is a convenient hosted environment
you can use to run the baseline and iterate on your models quickly.

To get started:
- Open the baseline notebook you'd like to work with from the table above.
- Save a copy in Google Drive for yourself.
- To ensure the GPU is enabled, click Runtime > Change runtime type.
Check that the "hardware accelerator" is set to GPU.
- Step through each section, pressing play on the code blocks to run the cells.
- Add your own data engineering and model code.
- Review the Getting Started section for details on how to submit results to the public leaderboard.
